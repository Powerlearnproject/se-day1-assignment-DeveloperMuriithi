#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.

    Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
        1. Development of programming languages
        2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
        3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    - Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  - Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  - Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  - Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  - Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  - Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    - Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall.
    Appropriate in less complex projects.

    - Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
    Appropriate in fast-paced or "changing" projects.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    1. Software Developer
Role:
Software Developers are responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications. They translate requirements into functional code and ensure the software meets user needs.

Responsibilities:

Design and Development: Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code based on technical specifications and requirements.

Collaboration: Work closely with other developers, QA engineers, and stakeholders to understand requirements and implement solutions.

Debugging and Troubleshooting: Identify and fix bugs or issues in the code.

Code Reviews: Participate in code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to best practices.

Documentation: Create and maintain technical documentation for the codebase and systems.

Continuous Learning: Stay updated with the latest programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

Testing: Write unit tests and collaborate with QA engineers to ensure software quality.

2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
Role:
QA Engineers are responsible for ensuring the software meets quality standards and is free of defects. They focus on testing and validating the software to ensure it functions as intended.

Responsibilities:

Test Planning: Develop test plans, test cases, and test scripts based on requirements.

Manual and Automated Testing: Perform manual testing and develop automated test scripts to validate functionality, performance, and security.

Bug Reporting: Identify, document, and track bugs using issue-tracking tools (e.g., Jira).

Regression Testing: Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

Collaboration: Work closely with developers to reproduce and resolve issues.

Quality Metrics: Monitor and report on software quality metrics, such as defect rates and test coverage.

User Experience Testing: Ensure the software is user-friendly and meets usability standards.

Continuous Improvement: Suggest improvements to the development process to enhance software quality.

3. Project Manager
Role:
The Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the software project. They ensure the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets the desired quality standards.

Responsibilities:

Project Planning: Define project scope, goals, timelines, and resource allocation.

Team Coordination: Facilitate communication and collaboration among team members (developers, QA engineers, designers, etc.).

Risk Management: Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.

Progress Tracking: Monitor project progress, track milestones, and adjust plans as needed.

Stakeholder Communication: Act as the primary point of contact for stakeholders, providing updates and managing expectations.

Budget Management: Ensure the project stays within budget and allocate resources effectively.

Quality Assurance: Work with QA engineers to ensure deliverables meet quality standards.

Documentation: Maintain project documentation, including requirements, schedules, and reports.

Problem Solving: Address issues and conflicts that arise during the project lifecycle.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

ntegrated Development Environments (IDEs)
Importance:

Code Editing and Debugging: IDEs provide a comprehensive environment for writing, editing, and debugging code. They often include syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and error detection, which improve developer productivity.

Integrated Tools: IDEs come with built-in tools for compiling, running, and testing code, reducing the need to switch between different applications.

Project Management: They help organize files, dependencies, and configurations within a project, making it easier to manage large codebases.

Customization: IDEs often support plugins and extensions, allowing developers to tailor the environment to their specific needs.

Collaboration: Some IDEs offer features for real-time collaboration, enabling multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously

Examples; Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code

2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
Importance:

Code History and Tracking: VCS tracks changes to the codebase, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. This is crucial for debugging and understanding the evolution of the project.

Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It supports branching and merging, facilitating parallel development.

Backup and Recovery: VCS acts as a backup system, ensuring that code is not lost due to hardware failure or accidental deletion.

Code Reviews: VCS platforms often integrate with code review tools, enabling teams to review and discuss changes before merging them into the main codebase.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): VCS integrates with CI/CD pipelines, automating testing and deployment processes.

Examples; Gits, Subversion


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  - Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  - Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  - Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  - System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  - Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.




#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.

    It helps AI models understand the intent behind a query
    It improves the quality and relevance of AI-generated content
    It reduces the need for manual review and post-generation editing

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

            How do I add numbers in Excel?	
            
            How do I add up a row of dollar amounts in Excel? I want to do this automatically for a whole sheet of rows with all the totals ending up on the right in a column called "Total".


            The second gives a lot more detail and context, and thus the AI is able to provide a more effective solution to the problem.
